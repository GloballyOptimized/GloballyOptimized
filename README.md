# Ayush Suryawanshi

**Senior AI Engineer** | Building production LLM systems that don't just demo well—they ship at scale and print money.

Currently architecting AI infrastructure at **Innoviti Technologies** where my systems process 5,000+ daily requests and have delivered **$84K+ in quantified business impact**. I don't build POCs that die in staging—I ship production-grade AI that survives contact with real users.

## What I Actually Build

### 🎯 Production Systems That Matter

**AI Analyst** • Context-aware NLQ-to-SQL engine  
Built the entire pipeline from scratch using Claude 3.7—now serving **1,600+ business queries daily** with 92% accuracy. Not a chatbot wrapper. Not a langchain demo. A real system handling actual business logic with PostgreSQL, Redis caching, and FastAPI microservices on AWS EC2.

**Multimodal QC Automation** • Qwen3-VL + YOLOv9 pipeline  
Engineered a vision-language system that auto-validates support tickets. Cut average QC time from **45 minutes to 4 minutes**—that's 11.25× faster, not "improved efficiency." Real computer vision, real business impact.

**Sheldon** • Multi-agent automation engine  
Orchestrated Llama 405B (via Sambanova) and Gemini 1.5 Flash to parse chaotic brand emails and Excel dumps into clean PostgreSQL records. **99.42% accuracy**, **$56K saved** in misconfiguration losses. This is what enterprise AI looks like when it's not just a GPT-4 API call.

**Link Fraud Detection** • Real-time ML serving  
Handles **3,700+ requests/hour** via FastAPI. Used Claude for EDA, scikit-learn for modeling. Result? **78% drop in fraud complaints**. No buzzwords—just a model that works under load.

## Tech I Use to Ship

I don't list technologies I've "worked with"—here's what I'm currently running in production:

**LLM Orchestration**  
Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4 • GPT-4o • Gemini 2.5 Pro • Llama 3 (405B) • DeepSeek R1 • Qwen 3 VL

**Backend Infrastructure**  
Python • Django • FastAPI • LangGraph • MCP • Celery • Redis • PostgreSQL • MongoDB

**AI/ML Stack**  
RAG architectures • Prompt engineering • LLM fine-tuning • ChromaDB/Milvus vector stores • YOLOv9 • Multimodal AI pipelines

**Production DevOps**  
AWS (EC2, SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda, RDS) • Docker/Kubernetes • MLFlow • Prometheus • Nginx/Gunicorn

## The Actual Numbers
```
  1,600+  daily NLQ-to-SQL queries processed
  3,700+  fraud detection requests/hour served
 11.25×   faster ticket validation (45min → 4min)
   92%+  accuracy across production AI systems
  $84K+  total cost savings delivered
99.42%   accuracy on brand automation engine
```

## What I'm Exploring Now

- **Advanced RAG**: Moving beyond naive chunking—experimenting with hybrid search, reranking, and query decomposition
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Building systems where specialized LLMs collaborate, not just chain sequentially
- **AI observability**: Because "it works on my machine" doesn't cut it when you're serving thousands of requests
- **Structured output enforcement**: Making LLMs return JSON that doesn't break your API

Let's Talk

I'm open to roles where I can build AI systems that actually ship—not research that stays in papers, not demos that never see production, not "AI strategy" that's just consulting. If you're solving hard problems with LLMs at scale, let's connect.
